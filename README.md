**Project Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has had a global impact unlike any other. According to preliminary statistics, one of the outcomes is a substantial reduction in crime rates in many communities around the world. Los Angeles is one of the most populated cities in the United States, with a population of over four million people. For a city of this scale, it is worthwhile to investigate the city's crime rate. Although overall crime in Los Angeles declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, homicides, shootings, and car thefts spiked. However, robberies, rapes, and lesser property crimes dropped off. The crime patterns shifted completely after COVID-19 shutdown orders were issued. The swings were dramatic, too, with killings hitting a decade high after years of sustained reductions, and shootings increasing nearly 40%. Meanwhile, robberies declined by 17% and reported rapes fell 25%.
Since people commit crimes at random, crime is a difficult subject for analytics and prediction. Our model was developed in part based on that need, to help people analyze the data. This project gives all the insights about the crimes that are occurred during this pandemic which would make law enforcement agencies work more efficiently and enables them to take many preventive measures against crime, such as reviewing past criminal data and forecasting future crimes.

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is the authorized law enforcement official could add the data to the database. And This project should provide a tracking system to give the details about the criminal cases that are happened in Los Angeles. Keeping track of criminal cases may be more beneficial in this precarious situation and help to ensure people's protection.
The main objectives of this project include:

● Crimes that are committed most often.

● Identify which type of weapons are most commonly used.

● Locating the areas that are particularly vulnerable to criminal activity.

● Number of victims in Los Angeles

● Determining which age group of people is most likely to fall victim to the crime.
